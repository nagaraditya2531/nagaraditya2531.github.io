I am a researcher in chemistry with a background in f-block chemistry and lanthanide complexation. My research experience includes lanthanide separation and coordination chemistry in ionic liquid media, with a focus on solvent effects and extraction behaviour.

My academic interests include f-block bonding, coordination chemistry, and applications in nuclear and separation chemistry.
